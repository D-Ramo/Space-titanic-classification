# Space-titanic-classification
This Jupyter Notebook analyzes a dataset of passengers onboard the Space Titanic during its ill-fated voyage. The notebook uses Python and several data analysis libraries to explore the dataset and draw insights from the data.
# Data Analysis
The notebook begins by loading the dataset and performing some initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get a sense of the distribution of the data. The notebook then proceeds to clean and preprocess the data, filling in missing values and encoding categorical variables.
# Machine Learning
The notebook also includes code for training several machine learning models on the Space Titanic dataset, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The models are trained to predict whether or not a passenger survived the disaster based on the other variables in the dataset.

The notebook uses cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of the models and chooses the best model to make predictions on the test set.
