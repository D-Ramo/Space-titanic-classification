# Space-titanic-classification
This Jupyter Notebook analyzes a dataset of passengers onboard the Space Titanic during its ill-fated voyage. The notebook uses Python and several data analysis libraries to explore the dataset and draw insights from the data.
# Data Analysis
The notebook begins by loading the dataset and performing some initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to get a sense of the distribution of the data. The notebook then proceeds to clean and preprocess the data, filling in missing values and encoding categorical variables.
# Machine Learning
The notebook also includes code for training using Gradient Boosting Classifier. The model is trained to predict whether or not a passenger survived the disaster based on the other variables in the dataset.

The notebook uses cross-validation techniques to evaluate the performance of the model and chooses the best hyperparameters to make predictions on the test set.
